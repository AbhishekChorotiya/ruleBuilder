## Key Concepts Summary

### Architecture Patterns

- **React Context + Custom Hooks**: Centralized state management
- **Component Composition**: Modular, reusable components
- **Type-Driven UI**: Input components determined by data types
- **Event Delegation**: Centralized event handling
- **Immutable State**: All state changes create new objects

### Data Flow

```
User Input ‚Üí Component Event ‚Üí Context Method ‚Üí State Update ‚Üí Re-render ‚Üí UI Update
```

### Component Hierarchy

```
App ‚Üí Group ‚Üí Condition ‚Üí ConditionRow ‚Üí Input Components
```

### State Structure

```
Rule ‚Üí Groups ‚Üí Conditions ‚Üí Fields (selectedKey, operator, values)
```

## Development Guidelines

### Before Making Changes

1. Read relevant context files
2. Understand data flow and dependencies
3. Consider impact on other components
4. Follow existing patterns and conventions

### Code Quality Standards

- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement immutable state updates
- Follow TailwindCSS styling patterns
- Maintain consistent prop interfaces
- Handle edge cases gracefully

### Testing Approach

- Unit test individual components
- Integration test data flow
- Test user workflows end-to-end
- Verify state synchronization

## Maintenance

### Keeping Memory Bank Updated

- Update context files when making significant changes
- Add new files for major new features
- Maintain consistency across documentation
- Review and optimize content regularly

### File Naming Convention

- `00-XX`: Ordered by importance/dependency
- Descriptive names indicating content focus
- `.md` extension for markdown formatting

This memory bank serves as a comprehensive knowledge base for AI systems working on the Rule Builder project. Use it as a reference for understanding, modifying, and extending the codebase while maintaining consistency and quality.
